# Cache JS

![Build Status](https://github.com/Pod-Point/cache-js/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml/badge.svg)

A cache service for JS.

## Usage

To install this package, run the following command:
```bash
npm install @pod-point/cache-js
```

Once installed, simply create a new instance of the Cache service and begin using it e.g.
```
import { Redis } from '@pod-point/cache-js';

const cacheService = new Redis();

await cacheService.put('foo', 'bar');
```

There are only 3 simple methods a cache service can carry out, and these are `put`, `get` and `remove`, all fairly self-explanatory!

When putting key/value pairs into the cache you can also set an expiry date, or a time in seconds until it should expire.

### Installation
